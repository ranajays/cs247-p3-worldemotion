# WorldEmotion Chat

7,000,000,000 people in the world. 7,000 spoken languages. 
But they share one universal language: facial expression.

There are few things more ubiquitous than a smile or a frown.

That's why when you send an emoticon on our chat, you're not getting a simple drawing.
You're getting a video emotion from one of the people "around the world" who use our app.

See and share a smile today.
